# Mhai Project

## Overview

Mhai (Mental Health AI) is an AI-driven platform designed for suicide prevention
by providing early intervention for individuals facing mental health challenges,
with a primary focus on anxiety and depression. The platform aims to support
individuals by recognizing their mental health condition, predicting potential
periods of crisis, and offering tailored interventions through its three main
pillars:

1. **AI-Driven Chat**: Interaction with a virtual AI persona to provide
   companionship and conversation.
2. **Surveys and Self-Assessments**: Regular emotional and mental health
   check-ins through structured surveys.
3. **Professional Support (Premium Tier)**: Direct connection with mental health
   professionals for deeper assistance and crisis intervention.

## Project Scope

Mhai combines AI technologies, surveys, and professional support to monitor and
assess mental health conditions, focusing on factors that increase the risk of
suicide. It employs a combination of pre-trained models and custom analytics to
detect patterns of distress and trigger timely interventions.

The project includes the development of mobile and web applicationsand it offers
both free and premium services, with the premium tier providing access to direct
mental health support.

## Future Directions

The Mhai project is actively seeking grants and partnerships to expand its reach
and continue developing its capabilities. We envision a world where mental
health support is accessible to everyone, anywhere, through innovative AI
technology.
